Assignment - NextYou


As part of our evaluation process for the AI Engineer Intern (Founding Tech Team) role at NextYou, we invite interested and eligible students to participate in a technical assignment focused on building a real-world Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based AI application in the wellness domain.


This assignment is designed to assess students’ understanding of RAG architectures, LLM integration, backend safety logic, and system-level product thinking, rather than just surface-level API usage.



Assignment Overview
Participants are required to design and build a full-stack AI micro-application titled: “Ask Me Anything”


The application should:
* Use a structured wellness / yoga knowledge base (Knowledge base will be provided by us)
* Implement a complete RAG pipeline (chunking, embeddings, retrieval)
* Include backend safety logic for health-related and sensitive queries
* Log user queries, retrieved context, generated responses, and safety flags in MongoDB
* Focus of assignment should be more inclined towards RAG & Backend.
 A good UI is good to have.


Participants are expected to submit:
* A GitHub repository with frontend, backend, and RAG logic
* A README explaining architecture, RAG design, safety logic, and setup steps
* A short demo video (2–5 minutes) showcasing the working application
* A detailed report explaining the design choices and implementation of the RAG pipeline
    
Evaluation Criteria
* RAG Architecture Design: The application should be well-structured, efficient, and scalable.
* Backend Safety Logic: The application should include measures to prevent harmful or inappropriate queries.
* User Experience: The application should be user-friendly and provide a seamless experience.
* Code Quality: The code should be well-documented, modular, and follow industry best practices.
* Documentation: The README should explain the architecture, RAG design, safety logic, and setup steps.
* Demo Video: The video should showcase the working application and explain the design choices and implementation of the RAG pipeline.
* Report: The report should explain the design choices and implementation of the RAG pipeline, and explain the safety logic and setup steps.
