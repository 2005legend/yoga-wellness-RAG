## SAFETY GUIDELINES AND CONTRAINDICATIONS

### General Safety Principles in Yoga

**Universal Safety Guidelines**:

1. **Never Force Any Pose**
   - Yoga should never cause sharp pain
   - Mild stretching sensation is normal
   - Always listen to your body
   - Discomfort = back out of the pose

2. **Warm Up Before Practicing**
   - Never jump into deep stretches without warm-up
   - Start with gentle movements and flowing sequences
   - Forward folds without warm-up cause hamstring injuries

3. **Use Props Liberally**
   - Yoga blocks, blankets, straps are NOT "cheating"
   - Props make poses accessible and safe
   - Modifications are intelligent, not inferior

4. **Alignment Over Depth**
   - Proper alignment in a modified pose beats alignment in deep pose
   - Small adjustments prevent major injuries

5. **Breath is Your Guide**
   - If holding breath, back out of pose
   - Smooth breathing indicates correct intensity
   - Shortness of breath = too intense

6. **Consistency Over Intensity**
   - Regular gentle practice beats occasional intense practice
   - Build gradually over weeks and months
   - No rush to achieve advanced poses
